## Push-Back Phrases

Use these when answers are vague:

- "What do you mean by 'helps'? Helps how specifically?"
- "You said 'users' — which users? All of them? Some?"
- "That sounds like a feature. What's the underlying problem?"
- "How would you measure if this is working?"
- "'Better' than what? By what metric?"
